# Getting Started

The best way to **get started** with Starbeam is by using the
Starbeam renderer for your framework.

- [Getting Started with React](../frameworks/react)
- [Getting Started with Preact](../frameworks/preact)

**This section** of the guides describes Starbeam's universal
reactivity system that works with any framework, and is a great
resource to learn all about Starbeam once you've gotten up and
running.
